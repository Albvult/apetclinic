So, i was learning the course about Spring Framework and one of the steps was to recreate known Spring referance application "Petclinic".
Originaly this project was made quite a time ago, so due to the evolving process of the framework, a lot of things became obsolete or even don't work correctly anymore.
That's why my version, which you are observing, was made by using some different, more up-to-date methods and is a bit different by itself.
